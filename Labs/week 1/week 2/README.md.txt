🔹 What We Learned

In this lab, we learned how to convert real-world problems into Python programs. We practiced using variables, arithmetic operations, conditional statements (if–elif–else), and loops. We also learned how to apply logical reasoning and decision-making in coding.

🔹 Challenges Faced

One of the main challenges was correctly writing compound conditions using and and making sure all cases were logically covered. Another challenge was handling boundary conditions correctly, such as checking temperature ranges (15–30°C). Managing counters inside loops also required careful attention.

🔹 Correctness of the Program

The correctness of the program depends on implementing the given rules accurately. If conditions are written properly and edge cases are handled correctly, the output will be reliable. Testing different input values helps ensure the program works as expected.
