🔹 Challenges Faced

One of the main challenges was properly structuring the code and deciding when to use a function and when to use a class. Understanding how methods access internal attributes using self was also slightly confusing at first. Managing clean program flow without repeating code required careful planning.

🔹 Correctness of the Program

The correctness of the program depends on proper function definitions, accurate return values, and correct implementation of class methods. If data is cleaned properly and calculations are logically implemented, the results will be accurate. Testing different datasets ensures reliability and correctness.
